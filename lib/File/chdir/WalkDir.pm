File::chdir::WalkDir

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use File::chdir::WalkDir

 my $do_something = sub {
   my ($filename, $directory) = @_;

   ...
 }

 walkdir( $dir, $do_something, qr/^\./ );
 # executes $do_something->($filename, $directory) [$directory is the folder
 # containing $filename] for all files within the directory and all 
 # subdirectories. In this case excluding all files and folders that 
 # are named with a leading `.'.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is a wrapper around David Golden's excellent module L<File::chdir> for walking directories and all subdirectories and executing code on all files which meet certain criteria.

=head1 FUNCTION

=head2 walkdir( $dir, $code_ref [, @exclusion_patterns, $opts_hashref ]);

C<walkdir> takes a base directory (either absolute or relative to the current working directory) and a code reference to be executed for each (qualifing) file. This code reference will by called with the arguments (i.e. C<@_>) containing the filename and the full folder that contains it. Through the magic of C<File::chdir>, the working directory when the code is executed will also be the folder containing the file.

Optionally exclusion patterns (i.e. C<qr//>) may by passed which will exclude BOTH files AND directories (and hence all subfiles/subdirectories) which match any of the patterns. This is a coarse exclusion. Fine detail may be used in excluding files by returning early from the code reference. This use is discouraged in favor of the C<exclude> option below.

An optional hash reference, passed as the last option to C<walkdir> will process key-value pairs as follows:

=over

=item *

C<exclude> - an array reference of exclusion patterns, same as passing to the function described above. In fact this mechanism is preferred since it is how these patterns are passed up the directory tree internally.

=item *

C<defer> - when set to a true value, tells C<walkdir> to process the files after listing the directory, recursing into the subdirectories, and excluding via the C<exclude> patterns. This is less efficient, however may be necessary if the actions taken might confuse C<readdir>. For example if changing the name of the file. This is only a per-directory defer however, moving files between directory might still be suspect.

=item *

C<act_on_directories> - when set to a true value, tells C<walkdir> to include the directory names as files to be acted on (subject to the normal exclusion mechanisms). For protection from infinite loops, directory actions are always deferred.

=back

Note: C<walkdir> will act on symlinked files but not on symlinked folders to prevent unwanted actions outside the folder and to prevent infinite loops. To exclude symlinked files too add a line like C<return if (-l $filename);> near the top of the code to be executed; this is an example of the fine exclusion mentioned above.
